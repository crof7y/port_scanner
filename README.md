This program was designed with the intention to scan your computer or host network (or really any device on your current network) and find
the open ports on your machine (or on your network). The results will show you what ports are open on which devices (as well as device information,
such as Operating System and Device Name) and which ports are vulnerable to attack.

I've found the most success running this program in a Linux environment as it seems to consume fewer resources, however I have used it as an .exe file on
my Windows machine and it does work, it's just...less than the Linux version.

This program does require a few packages be installed to run. This link: https://youtu.be/WWtAfmdvYXg contains a video of me using the program and 
detailing the necessary packages to install. Consider the video to be 'README_butReallyWatchMe.mp4'
